## Inter-group-emotion-processing

This repository is associated with the project 'Influence of cooperation and competition on judgments of ingroup and outgroup facial expressions of emotion'.

Goal: 

This project aims to explore (a) how group membership and functional relations (competition, cooperation) interact to affect judgments of facial expressions of emotion; and (b) whether there are identifiable perceptual mechanisms and psychophysiological markers associated with emotion processing in inter-group contexts.

This repository includes:
1) Analysis of behavioural data
2) Analysis of eye-tracking and psychophysiological data
