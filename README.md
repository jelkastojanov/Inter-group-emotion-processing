## Intergroup emotion processing

This repository stores R code for the analyses of behavioural, eye-tracking and psychophysiological data associated with this project: https://osf.io/n8bvy/

This project examines (a) how group membership and group relations (i.e., between- and within-group competition and cooperation) interact to affect judgments of facial expressions of emotion; and (b) whether there are identifiable perceptual mechanisms and psychophysiological markers associated with emotion processing in intergroup contexts.

This repository includes:
1) Analysis of behavioural data (Experiments 1 & 2)
2) Analysis of eye-tracking and psychophysiological data (Experiment 3)
