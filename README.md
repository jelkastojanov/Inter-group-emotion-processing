# Inter-group-emotion-processing
This repository is associated with the project 'Influence of Cooperation and Competition on Judgmentsâ€™ of In-group and Out-group Emotional Expressions'.

Goal: This project aims to explore (a) how group membership and functional relations (competition, cooperation) interact to affect emotion recognition; and (b) whether there are identifiable perceptual mechanisms and psychophysiological markers associated with emotion processing in inter-group contexts.

This repository includes:
1) Analysis of behavioural data
2) Analysis of eye-tracking and psychophysiological data
